When to Perform Rotation Operations in Insertion Operations?

If the Balance Factor > 1, it means that the height of the left subtree of the node is greater than the height of the right subtree. In this case, either a right rotation or a left-right rotation operation is performed.

a. If the newly added node is to the left of the parent node, a right rotation operation is performed.

b. If the newly added node is to the right of the parent node, a left-right rotation operation is performed.

If the Balance Factor < -1, it means that the height of the right subtree of the node is greater than the height of the left subtree. In this case, either a left rotation or a right-left rotation operation is performed.

a. If the newly added node is to the right of the parent node, a left rotation operation is performed.

b. If the newly added node is to the left of the parent node, a right-left rotation operation is performed.
